"""Shared integration contract for marketplace adapters (Phase A).

Phase A deliberately defines ONLY the read-only surface area: a configuration
check plus a connection verification report.  Write capabilities (draft
creation, file/image uploads, listing activation) are intentionally absent
from this contract; they will be added in explicitly approved later phases.

Not defining write methods here is a safety feature: an adapter cannot grow a
write path by accident - it would have to extend this contract first, which
shows up in code review and in the Phase A security tests.
