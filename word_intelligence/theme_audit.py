"""Theme auditing: does each production theme's vocabulary hold up?

For every theme we resolve its intended topic, grade every puzzle word
(on-topic / related / weak / off-topic / flagged), detect intra-theme
duplicates, and suggest replacements drawn from the same topic's strong
pool.  Audits are READ-ONLY - they never rewrite themes.
