"""Word quality scoring: puzzle-worthiness, roles, exclusivity.

Quality is independent of classification confidence: a word can be a
PERFECT gardening match yet unsuitable for children's puzzles, or a great
general word with weak topic ties.  Keeping the axes separate preserves
honest reporting (mission §13).
