WHAT CAN BE REUSED
• The interior PDF is the source print file. It can be reused only when a platform's trim size, bleed, margins, and paper choice match this book.
• The KDP full cover wrap is ready for Amazon KDP only. Do not upload it to another printer without rebuilding it on that printer's template; spine width and cover dimensions can differ.
• The front-cover PNG is for listing images and previews, not a print wrap.

START HERE
1. Use 01_KDP_UPLOAD for Amazon KDP.
2. Use 02_ETSY_DIGITAL or 03_DIRECT_WEBSITE for the buyer-download PDF.
3. Use the printer-specific folders for IngramSpark, Lulu, and Bookvault. Each contains the reusable interior plus clear instructions for the required platform cover template.
4. Before every upload, review the platform's current official guide linked in that folder and run its upload preview/proof.

The included listing_cover.png is for your listing imagery. Etsy currently allows up to five digital files, up to 20 MB each; use a ZIP only if your buyer download needs multiple files.
Before listing, confirm the file size and use a clear buyer-facing filename.

The interior file is supplied as a possible starting point. Reuse it only after confirming its trim size, bleed, margins, paper selection, and page count match your {platform} title setup.

Do NOT upload kdp_cover_reference_only.pdf as the final {platform} cover. Build a new full cover spread using that platform's current template/calculator. Printer templates use their own spine width and cover dimensions.

Then upload the platform-specific interior and newly built cover as separate PDFs. Confirm embedded fonts, flattened transparency, no crop/trim marks, and 300-DPI images where applicable. Order or review a proof before release.
